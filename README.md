# titanic-survivals-prediction

**Dataset**: Titanic kaggle dataset https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data, using train and test dataset.

**Project Goals**
- It's a classification problem. 
- Practice EDA on the dataset using python.
- Predict survived and unsurvived passengers using various Ml models.

**Methodolgy**
- Running exploratory data analysis, dealing with missing values
- Feature engineering using sklearn LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder
- Try various models on the train dataset .
- Select catboost model which achieve the best cross validation accuracy score of 81.32%
- Use catboost model to predict surviving status on unseen data (test dataset).
